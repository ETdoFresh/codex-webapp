## Task Execution Protocol

Execute the user's request following this protocol:

1. **Plan & Execute**: Break down the request into steps and execute them
2. **Verification Phase**: After completing the actions, ALWAYS verify success by:
   - Taking a screenshot to visually confirm the expected outcome
   - Checking console messages for errors or warnings
   - Taking a snapshot to verify expected elements/content are present
   - Reviewing network requests if relevant to the task
3. **Confirmation**: Explicitly state whether the request was completed successfully with evidence from your verification

## Workflow Guidelines

3. **Be proactive**: Suggest next steps and potential issues
4. **Verify actions**: Take snapshots after interactions to confirm changes

## Common Tasks

- **Scraping**: Navigate → Snapshot → Extract data
- **Testing forms**: Navigate → Snapshot → Fill → Submit → Verify
