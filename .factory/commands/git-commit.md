description: Generate an imperative git commit subject from current changes and push it
argument-hint: "[optional subject hints]"
---

Review the working tree and staged changes to craft a git commit message automatically.

1. Run `git status --short` and summarize every file that changed.
2. Inspect the diff (`git diff --cached` and `git diff`) to understand the intent of each modification.
3. Produce a commit subject that:
   - Starts with one of **Add**, **Allow**, **Enhance**, **Fix**, **Improve**, **Refactor**, **Remove**, or **Update**.
   - Uses the imperative mood in Title Case, stays at or below 72 characters, and avoids unnecessary trailing punctuation.
   - Reflects the primary change set clearly.
4. When the diff warrants extra context, craft a commit body immediately after a blank line that lists 2â€“5 bullet points, each beginning with an imperative verb and mirroring our style (e.g., "- Introduce â€¦", "- Update â€¦"). Capture the key technical details, major files, or impacts from the change. For tiny, self-explanatory commits, you may omit the bullet section entirely.
5. Confirm the subject and bullet list aloud, then stage everything with `git add -A`.
6. Commit using the generated subject, include the bullet list body when present, and avoid adding trailing signatures or co-author trailers.
7. Push to `origin/$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)`.
8. Report the exact commands executed and the final commit hash.
